### Development Installation and start

Download project and then open terminal inside `.../WP-plugin/backend/` folder. Then run command `npm install`.
This installs all the backend dependencies.

Powershell example with path:

```powershell
PS C:\Projects\WP-plugari\backend> npm install
```

Aftrer dependencies installation check `.env` file inside `.../WP-plugin/backend/` folder has your own correct SQL database settings.

Then run command `npm run dev` inside `.../WP-plugin/backend/` folder and the backend should start in port 3000. This port also can be changed inside `.env` if needed.

```powershell
PS C:\Projects\WP-plugari\backend> npm run dev

> inno-savelan-backend@1.0.0 dev
> nodemon src/index.ts

[nodemon] 3.0.1
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: ts,json
[nodemon] starting `ts-node src/index.ts`
[14.12.2023 12.28.32][info] : Listening: http://localhost:3000
[14.12.2023 12.28.33][info] : Data source has been initialized
```

## Save LAN tracker Frontend

Frontend is responsible to show data from backend. It is made with React and Javascript.

### Development Installation and start

Download project and then open terminal inside `.../WP-plugin/frontend/` folder. Then run command `npm install`.
This installs all the frontend dependencies.

Powershell example with path:

```powershell
PS C:\Projects\WP-plugari\frontend> npm install
```

Then run command `npm run start` inside `.../WP-plugin/frontend` folder and the frontend trys to open in port 3000, but our backend is in that port so React asks:

```powershell
? Something is already running on port 3000.

Would you like to run the app on another port instead? Â» (Y/n)
```

Say Y, then our frontend starts in Port 3001.
